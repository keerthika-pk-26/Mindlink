        <p>In a prosperous kingdom nestled between majestic mountains, there was a wise king who noticed that his people had become complacent. They complained about small inconveniences but never took action to solve problems. The king decided to teach them a valuable lesson about initiative and opportunity.</p>

        <p>One moonless night, the king had his servants place a massive boulder right in the center of the busiest road leading to the marketplace. The stone was so large that it completely blocked the path, making it impossible for carts and travelers to pass through.</p>

        <div class="character">
            <strong>The Wealthy Merchant:</strong> The first to encounter the obstacle was a wealthy silk merchant on his way to the market. He arrived in his ornate carriage drawn by four white horses. When he saw the boulder, he became furious. "How irresponsible of the king's men! Don't they maintain these roads?" he complained loudly. Then he ordered his driver to turn around and take a longer, more difficult route to the market. He missed important business deals that day.
        </div>

        <div class="character">
            <strong>The Royal Courtier:</strong> Next came a high-ranking courtier dressed in fine silks and jewels. He examined the boulder from a distance and declared, "This is clearly someone else's responsibility. The road maintenance crew should handle this." He then carefully walked around the boulder through the muddy field, ruining his expensive shoes, and continued to the palace without looking back.
        </div>

        <div class="character">
            <strong>The Army General:</strong> A military general on horseback arrived next. He surveyed the situation and announced, "This is a security risk! Enemies could be hiding behind this rock." He posted guards around the boulder and went to report the "security breach" to the king, wasting valuable military resources.
        </div>

        <p>Dozens of other travelers passed by throughout the day. Some complained about the king's poor governance. Others blamed the weather or bad luck. Many simply turned back or found alternative routes. But nobody attempted to move the boulder.</p>

        <p>As evening approached, a humble farmer named Ramesh came walking down the road. He was carrying a heavy basket of fresh vegetables to sell at the market. Unlike the others, Ramesh didn't complain or look for someone to blame. He simply set down his basket and assessed the situation.</p>

        <p>Ramesh noticed that the boulder wasn't as deeply embedded as it appeared. He found a strong branch and used it as a lever. With considerable effort and multiple attempts, he managed to shift the boulder slightly. Encouraged by this progress, he continued pushing and rocking the stone until it finally rolled to the side of the road.</p>

        <p>As Ramesh picked up his basket to continue his journey, he noticed something glittering where the boulder had been. It was a beautiful leather purse filled with gold coins and a note that read: "This reward belongs to whoever removes the obstacle from the path."</p>

        <p>The king, who had been watching from a hidden spot, emerged and explained to Ramesh: "You have demonstrated what I hoped to teach my people. While others saw only a problem, you saw an opportunity to make things better. The obstacle wasn't placed there to inconvenience people, but to reveal their character."</p>

        <p><strong>Moral:</strong> The obstacles we face in life are not placed there to stop us, but to test our character and creativity. Those who take initiative and face challenges head-on often find unexpected rewards. Don't be like those who only complain about problems - be the one who solves them. Every difficulty you encounter contains within it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.</p>
